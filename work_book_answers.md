## Question 1: Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

The internet was first created in 1960s by the US Military. There are a large amount of major events that have happened through the course of the internet starting five of these being Google search engine was born in 1998, First online dating site, match.com launches in 1993, the dotcom bubble bursts in 2000 and Google unveils its Google assistant. 

1998: Google search engine is born 

A search engine is a program that searches the World Wide Web based on keywords or characters specified by the user. Currently there are a number of search engines running such as Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and finally Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin launch Google on Stanford university's network this was originally known as BackRub. Initially Google was a research project for the two founders however after receiving an investment of $100,000 from angel investors the two decided to turn this into a business and renaming themselves as Google in 1998. 

Google was able to surpass its competitors and change how users interact with the the web by 1. Speed - Google managed to load search results 5-10x faster than its competitors at the time 2. Much deeper index - Google was able to have capture a lot more webpages than its competitors such as Yahoo and Bing. 3. Algorithms - This helped launch Google into being one of the most used search engines, using algorithms was able to put the best sites at the top of the search results making searching a lot more user friendly. 

Google is a key event in the creation of the internet as it become and currently is the biggest library in the world and giving access to a vast amount of information at the users fingertips as well as the ability to monetize the internet. 

1993: First Online Dating Site, Match.com launches. - WORK IN PROGRESS

By 1993 the internet was well and truely established into modern day society large business were being built and the power of the internet was truely being shown. One way this was done was the ability to connect two people together with the goal of finding love. Match.com was founded by Gary Kremen,

2000: Dotcom bubble bursts - WORK IN PROGRESS

By the 2000s the internet was exploding wih internet businesses starting up in every industry and the ability to raise capital was as easy as it gets. Unfortunately though this lead to one of the biggest crashes to date and still shapes our lives now. The dot-com bubble was between 1995 - 2000 however the effects of it all came crashing down in 2000 when a huge amount of .com companies filed for bankruptcy. This was all caused by the large amounts of money being pumped into dot.com startups while ignoring the basic metrics when investing. You can see this through the way companies were cashing out for twice the amount they sold at during 1997 and 1998. Once the bubble did finally pop it had a disastrous effect across the United States of America with Silicon Valley alone losing 200,000 jobs. While the event and after effect of the dot com bubble was horrendous the reason the internet is where it is today is because of that. All of the money poured into the tech startups built out the infrastructure and economic foundation to allow the internet to mature in a tangible way.

## Question 2: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- packets - Every webpage that you use comes in a series of packets. Packets are a 'package' of data that travels along a given network once they have been received they're then put back together to make the data.. A packets contributes to the internet by passing adn sharing data across the internet. If packets where not part of the internet we would not be able to share data and access the data. 

- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) - IP address stands for internet protocol address. An IP address is a network address for your computer, a postcode address essentially. the v4 and v6 means the amount of IP addresses we can support. As there are only a limited amount of IP addresses we can support in v4 we must increase it to support more. The reason we need IP addresses is to know where to send data and receive data.

- routers and routing - A device that directs or routes information around the internet. When a data packet arrives the router then reads the IP address and sends the packet along the best and quickest route to its destination. It is important for the web because its the 'highway' for information and allows data to travel to the right destination.

- domains and DNS - Domain Name System: is a set of standards for how computers exchange data on the Internet. The DNS turns a user-friendly domain names like bbc.co.uk into an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

## Question 3: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- TCP - Another feature on the internet is called the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is not controlled by any single company, this allows it to be modified easily to suit any device. TCP transports segments of data unlike IP which transports packets The TCP is essential in the development of the internet as it is the courier which deals with delivering the data packets to various hosts over the internet. It is dependent on the IP.

- HTTP and HTTPS (word count guide: 150 - 300 words) - HTTP is Hypertext transfer protocol while HTTPS is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). The basic flow of how HTTPS and HTTP work is that 1. HTTP request is made from the HTTP client (client being the users computer), the request then travels to the HTTP server where it collects the necessary data and moves it back with a HTTP reply. HTTP is a client-server protocol that allows users to request web pages from web servers. When a user wants to access a web page, a browser sends an HTTP Request message to the web server. The server responds with the requested web page. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP sending important information back in an encrypted way and makes it harder for attacks to happen on the website which could result in loss of important user information.  

- web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) - Web browsers translates websites and webpages into readable content, some example of browsers are FireFox,Chrome and Safari. This is done using HTTP and HTTPS. Basically the general flow of the user is that the browser (client) makes a request to the server for the data (user information, images etc...) Once a request has been made the server responds with a reply sending back the necessary data. This is where the browser must then present that information into readable content for the human eye to see. It turns the HTML layout tags in the page into the appropriate commands for the operating system, which causes the formation of the text characters and images for screen and printer. Developer tools are ways for developers in particular to get 'under the hood' and see how the webpage / website is made up. Developer tools are helpful for understanding how the site works, the styling done to it and the network request it makes. Browsers are an important tool to make the web accessible to everyone, as time goes on they're smarter and handling the way data is displayed across the web whether that be on mobile, desktop etc...

## Question 13: The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

```
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
	i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
```

## Question 14: Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

  Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations
  Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart


## Question 15: Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.

## Question 16: An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

  eggs (1)
  peanuts (2)
  shellfish (4)
  strawberries (8)
  tomatoes (16)
  chocolate (32)
  pollen (64)
  cats (128)

  So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

  Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them: a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item b) the full list of allergies.
