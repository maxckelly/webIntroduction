## Question 1: Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.

The internet was first created in 1960s by the US Military. There are a large amount of major events that have happened through the course of the internet starting five of these being Google search engine was born in 1998, First online dating site, match.com launches in 1993, the dotcom bubble bursts in 2000 and Google unveils its Google assistant. 

1998: Google search engine is born 

A search engine is a program that searches the World Wide Web based on keywords or characters specified by the user. Currently there are a number of search engines running such as Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo and finally Google. Larry Page and Sergey Brin launch Google on Stanford university's network this was originally known as BackRub. Initially Google was a research project for the two founders however after receiving an investment of $100,000 from angel investors the two decided to turn this into a business and renaming themselves as Google in 1998. 

Google was able to surpass its competitors and change how users interact with the the web by 1. Speed - Google managed to load search results 5-10x faster than its competitors at the time 2. Much deeper index - Google was able to have capture a lot more webpages than its competitors such as Yahoo and Bing. 3. Algorithms - This helped launch Google into being one of the most used search engines, using algorithms was able to put the best sites at the top of the search results making searching a lot more user friendly. 

Google is a key event in the creation of the internet as it become and currently is the biggest library in the world and giving access to a vast amount of information at the users fingertips as well as the ability to monetize the internet. 

1993: First Online Dating Site, Match.com launches. - WORK IN PROGRESS

By 1993 the internet was well and truely established into modern day society large business were being built and the power of the internet was truely being shown. One way this was done was the ability to connect two people together with the goal of finding love. Match.com was founded by Gary Kremen,

2000: Dotcom bubble bursts - WORK IN PROGRESS

By the 2000s the internet was exploding with internet businesses starting up in every industry and the ability to raise capital was as easy as it gets. Unfortunately though this lead to one of the biggest crashes to date and still shapes our lives now. The dot-com bubble was between 1995 - 2000 however the effects of it all came crashing down in 2000 when a huge amount of .com companies filed for bankruptcy. This was all caused by the large amounts of money being pumped into dot.com startups while ignoring the basic metrics when investing. You can see this through the way companies were cashing out for twice the amount they sold at during 1997 and 1998. 

Once the bubble did finally pop it had a disastrous effect across the United States of America with Silicon Valley alone losing 200,000 jobs. While the event and after effect of the dot com bubble was horrendous the reason the internet is where it is today is because of that. All of the money poured into the tech startups built out the infrastructure and economic foundation to allow the internet to mature in a tangible way.  

Five key events:

## Question 2: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- packets - Every webpage that you use comes in a series of packets. Packets are a 'package' of data that travels along a given network once they have been received they're then put back together to make the data.. A packets contributes to the internet by passing adn sharing data across the internet. If packets where not part of the internet we would not be able to share data and access the data. 

- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) - IP address stands for internet protocol address. An IP address is a network address for your computer, a postcode address essentially. the v4 and v6 means the amount of IP addresses we can support. As there are only a limited amount of IP addresses we can support in v4 we must increase it to support more. The reason we need IP addresses is to know where to send data and receive data.

- routers and routing - A device that directs or routes information around the internet. When a data packet arrives the router then reads the IP address and sends the packet along the best and quickest route to its destination. It is important for the web because its the 'highway' for information and allows data to travel to the right destination.

- domains and DNS - Domain Name System: is a set of standards for how computers exchange data on the Internet. The DNS turns a user-friendly domain names like bbc.co.uk into an Internet Protocol (IP) address.

## Question 3: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- TCP - Another feature on the internet is called the Transport Control Protocol (TCP). TCP is not controlled by any single company, this allows it to be modified easily to suit any device. TCP transports segments of data unlike IP which transports packets of data. The TCP is essential in the development of the internet as it is the courier which deals with delivering the data to various hosts over the internet. It is dependent on the IP.

- HTTP and HTTPS (word count guide: 150 - 300 words) - HTTP is Hypertext transfer protocol while HTTPS is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). The basic flow of how HTTPS and HTTP work is that 1. HTTP request is made from the HTTP client (client being the users computer), the request then travels to the HTTP server where it collects the necessary data and moves it back with a HTTP reply. HTTP is a client-server protocol that allows users to request web pages from web servers. When a user wants to access a web page, a browser sends an HTTP Request message to the web server. The server responds with the requested web page. HTTPS is a secure version of HTTP sending important information back in an encrypted way and makes it harder for attacks to happen on the website which could result in loss of important user information.  

- Web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools) - Web browsers translates websites and webpages into readable content, some example of browsers are FireFox,Chrome and Safari. This is done using HTTP and HTTPS. Basically the general flow of the user is that the browser (client) makes a request to the server for the data (user information, images etc...) Once a request has been made the server responds with a reply sending back the necessary data. This is where the browser must then present that information into readable content for the human eye to see. It turns the HTML layout tags in the page into the appropriate commands for the operating system, which causes the formation of the text characters and images for screen and printer. Developer tools are ways for developers in particular to get 'under the hood' and see how the webpage / website is made up. Developer tools are helpful for understanding how the site works, the styling done to it and the network request it makes. Browsers are an important tool to make the web accessible to everyone, as time goes on they're smarter and handling the way data is displayed across the web whether that be on mobile, desktop etc...

- Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology) - TCP is essential to the client and server communication as it is the way data is transported across the web without TCP we wouldn't be able to view the sites on the web. HTTP and HTTPS has contributed to the development by allowing browsers and servers to securely move data to and from the client and server this is helpful for the protection of information on the internet. Web browsers are another tool which has improved the client and server communication across the internet by improving tools for developers to develop better sites, making it easier and quicker for users to render and load websites while staying secure. Each technology is important to each other and the development of the internet.  

## Question 4: Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.

- Array: An array is an object that stores or "holds". Similar to a list it can store a number of objects inside the array these can be strings, booleans or integers. Each array item then has an index this allows us to find the object and access it. The reason you would use an array is to store a number of data types, this can be for example a shopping list, a list of users, user emails or a list of names. You would typically use arrays when you're dealing with a large amount of objects with the same data type. 

- Hash: Hash are similar to dictionaries. Hashes assign values to keys so that values can be looked up by their key. Unlike arrays hashes can store a number of objects such as arrays, variables as well as their values. You would use a hash when you want to store large data types with different/a lot of values. As mentioned before it is very handy as the hash acts as a dictionary and you can then access all the data inside the hash. 

- Sets: Sets implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. Its a hybrid of Array's allowing the computer to process the request quicker unlike arrays that can take up a lot of power. You would use sets when you have a large amount of data that needs processing 

## Question 5: Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

- Complied programming languages require a tool called complier. Before the program can run the compiler must convert the high-level code into a series of 'stages'. The code on the machine is then specific to that machine. Interpreted programming languages on the other hand require a tool called interpreter. The interpreter converts the source code to machine code line by line, while the program is running. The difference between the two is that compilers compile all the code in advance while interpreters compile the code live. So while the program is running the code is being compiled. Generally interpreter languages are more flexible and easier to debug compared to compilers.  

## Question 6: Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

- Javascript - Javascript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects and methods. It's syntax is based on the Java and C language. Javascript has a number of advantages and disadvantages one being popularity, Javascript is heavily used and has a large community around it making it easier to understand, debug and work on the language to the resources available. A disadvantage however is that browser support is sometimes interpreted differently by different browsers. Another advantage of Javascript is the extended functionality. Javascript has a range of third party add-ons which can be executed on desired web pages to extend its functionality. However a downside to Javascript is its client side security. Because code executes on the users computer it can be accessed easily through the browser if the necessary security isn't put in place. Because Javascript is an interpreted language it reduces the time it takes to load on the browser. This allows the developers to improve their loading time due to the fact interpreted languages read the code line by line unlike compilers. Overall there are many pros and cons for Javascript and each language has their own drawbacks. 

- Ruby - Ruby is a great language and one many developers learn first and quickly. One of the biggest advantages for using Ruby is the ability to put together an application, web app etc... quickly and easily. This means it is highly used amongst the start-up industry as they're looking to get their program out there as soon as possible. However a con to Ruby is that it struggles to handle large loads, an example of this was Twitter, when they were first starting out they developed their platform in Ruby however once the site grew and the load increased they found it hard to keep up using Ruby. Another advantage of Ruby is that it is easy to use and understand and highly readable. Ruby is a very friendly program and the syntax has a lot of advantages. However a disadvantage to this is that it doesn't have many 'plug and play' and the lack of documentation around Ruby isn't as good as something like Javascript. Ruby is purely object orientated programming which makes it easier and simpler to edit states and develop your site. Ruby is dynamic and interpreted meaning you don't have to compile it to test it unlike languages such as C.

## Question 7: Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

- An ethical issue that people must think of when developing is the safety of peoples data. There are many criminal acts such as theft, fraud and more which are fueled by our online presents. When a user is signing up to a website, making payments and storing information this can open up the opportunity for hackers and criminal organisations to attack those sites and gain access to that data to be used against the users. Ways in which the developers can help prevent this from happening is 1. Adding more protection to their accounts. Some way of doing this is by adding text message verifications, making sure a password contains a certain amount of characters and potentially adding a security code which is sent via text. This is extra way to prevent users accounts from being hacked and the lose of data. 2. Validation both on the server and browser side. To ensure that 'bots' or hackers aren't accessing your site you should have validation on both the browser side and server side trying to pick up any fields that might have been left empty due to scripting code etc... 3. Finally one of the best ways to prevent your site from being attacked is using HTTPS this guarantees that users are talking to the server they expect and that nobody else can intercept or change the content they're seeing in transit.

- The second ethical issue that you must think of is selling on the internet and how aggressive your sales and marketing approach can be towards the users and that the product you're selling is actively described as is. You can't actively mislead users into think a product is something else. Some ways which you can mislead users is by images, displaying something in different condition that it is actually in, displaying it in a different size etc... A good example of unethical behaviour was the famous Fyre festival which was an event advertised online and promised the users a completely different experience than what they received / where able to deliver. Another way in which you can deceive customers is putting urgency on a product. This can be done through selling of products saying that there are a limit amount available or that they have the cheapest ticket available. Companies such as Viagogo are under investigation for advertising their tickets as the cheapest option only to find out that at the end of the checkout process the consumers are being charged with a $52 booking fee making the price equal to its competitors. This is a great example of misleading consumers to go to your site and complete a purchase only to find out that the advertisement was incorrect.

- An example of an ethical issue involved the ability to run a criminal drug trafficking business over the internet. This started with Ross Ulbricht and how he started The Silk Road website on the dark web. The Silk Road was a site which could only be accessed on the dark web where you can buy anything from drugs, guns and people. This all started with the 31 year old Ross Ulbricht. At the time of his arrest he was worth $28.5 million dollars. To acquire this wealth Ross developed a marketplace website where drug dealers, arms dealers and more could go online and sell their product, all of the product was then bought through Bitcoin making it untraceable to the police. The Silk Road broke many laws and is a great example of how the internet and web development can be used for the worse. With a cash flow of $213 million dollars the Silk Road was a well run business operated purely by online developers. After starting out developing the site as a hobbies Ross realize that the potential for this site was beyond him. An obvious and easy way to prevent this ethical breach was to first shutdown the site, however this did not happen and he was instead drawn into it more. Although what Ross was doing was ethically wrong it also proved a target for criminals to act unethical towards him. At the peak of the sites life Ross was being attacked from many hackers trying to get into the site and gain access to his BitCoin account. Ways to prevent the attacks from stealing his money was to hire a team of online hackers to actively stay one step ahead of the attackers. This was done by constant updates, security checks and finding loop holes in the code which gave them access to the servers. With the help of developers and the late nights Ross was able to prevent hacks on his site, however this only lasted so long before they figured out a different approach to get in. The Silk Road was a great example of how the internet and the ability of developers can change the world for the worse. Ross was eventually captured by police in a library in San Fran where they snatched the laptop from his hands afraid that he would quickly delete the code and then would not be able to trace him to the site. Ross was sentence for life in prison for the unethical behaviour he committed. 

## Question 8: Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language (100 words)

- Control flow is flow of how the computer reads the code. Originally the code is read by the computer from the top down. However, when you change the control flow you can alter the way the code is read for a brief period of time. This is done using conditionals and loops. Some examples of these are if statements, while and until statements, case statements and each methods. This allows you to make the program loop over a certain area till a value is equal to something. You can see an example of an if statement below. Altering the control flow is a good way constantly run an application depending on the input. 

```
i = 0

if i = 0 
  puts "Zero"
  else 
  puts "Nope not a zero
end
```

## Question 9: Explain type coercion (100 words)

- Type coercion is changing one object's type to a different object type. By this I mean you are able to change a string for example to an integer `"21"` to `21` and back again. To do this you use methods such as `to_s`, `to_i`, `to_f`. The reason you would change the data type is to have it behave differently in your program. For example you might as the user for their age but instead of storing it as a string you want to store it as an integer so you can then use it in equations etc...

## Question 10: Explain data types, using examples (100 words)

- When writing programs you will use a number of data types. There are a number of data types 
1. Booleans - This is either true or false. This can be shown simply by typing true or false, or in when assigned to a variable such as `var_name = true` or `var_name = false` 
2. Symbols - Symbols are used to represent other objects. To generate a symbol you first must put a colon before an identifier such as `:name`. Symbols cannot be changed and are often used in hashes. 
3. Numbers - Generally defined as a series of digits, using a decimal mark. An example of this would be `9.27`. 
4. Strings - Strings are a set of input put between two quotation marks Strings can be assigned to variables such as `string = "Max"`.
5. Arrays are a way to store more than one or more piece's of data. Data in an array is seperated by a comma and can be accessed by the user again. An example of an `array is array = ["max", "kelly"]`.
6. Hashes - A hash assigns its values to its keys. A key is a way to call upon that data and also allows for better structure of your code. A key can also be assigned to different data types such as a number, string or boolean. See example: `hash = { :name = "Max" :age = 21 }`


## Question 11: Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”

- The classes you would use to solve the issue of no staff would be 1. A employee class 2. A menu class and 3. An order class. The reason for the employee class would be to define and give the user an experience of an employee asking them. The class would be defined with instance variables of name, a bit about them as well as asking the customers what they would like to order. The next class would be the menu class. This class would outline the template for what will be on the menu, categories, drinks etc... Finally the order class would outline the order that is received from the customer and that order is then placed into the system. 

## Question 12: Identify and explain the error in the code that is preventing correct execution of the program (100 words)

- There are currently two errors in the below code which is preventing the correct execution of the program. The first error was that the celsius variable was not being puts. This means that the user was not entering in the value and the value wasn't being assigned to the variable called celsius to fix this you simply put `puts celsius` under celsius. However once celsius is receiving the user input the program was still causing an error. This was due to the fact the user input from a gets is always received as a string. When a string was passed into the equation it returned an error. To fix this error you would use type coercion and change the string to an integer such as `celsius = gets.to_i. See below for correct code. 

```
Correct Code: My response.
  celsius = gets.to_i
  puts celsius
  fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
  print "The result is: "
  print fahrenheit
  puts "."
```
```
  Incorrect Code:
  celsius = gets
  fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
  print "The result is: "
  print fahrenheit
  puts "."
```

## Question 13: The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

```
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
  i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]
```

My Answer:
```
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i != arr.length - 1)
  if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
    first_num = arr[i]
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = first_num
  end
  i = i + 1
end

p arr
```

## Question 14: Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations. Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart


## Question 15: Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

```
temperature = 14
rainingBoolean = true

if temperature < 15 && rainingBoolean == true
  puts "It's wet and cold"
elsif temperature < 15 && rainingBoolean == false
  puts "Its not raining but cold"
elsif temperature >= 15 && rainingBoolean == false 
  puts "It's warm but not raining"
else
  puts "It's warm and raining"
end
```
## Question 16: An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

eggs (1)
peanuts (2)
shellfish (4)
strawberries (8)
tomatoes (16)
chocolate (32)
pollen (64)
cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them: a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item b) the full list of allergies.
